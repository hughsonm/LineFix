# LineFix
A program to predict which NBA team will cover the betting line.
Currently looks at the two teams' names, their amount of rest prior to the game, and the betting line prior to the game, in order to predict which team will cover the betting line.
I have been training it on the entire 2018-2019 season, with data pulled from [SportsDatabase](https://sportsdatabase.com/nba/query).
In its current state, this predictor is about as good as a coin-flip :(
